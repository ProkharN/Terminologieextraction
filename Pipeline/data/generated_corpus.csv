So we think that it's important that the state intervene at every level necessary to be sure that people's constitutional rights are actually accessible to them, and I mentioned the gilded age because I think that that is the alternative here in early twentieth century america or britain there were very few protections for ordinary people basically no social welfare net. This has is that it's going to lead to the state being more willing to take and more willing to actually spend things on public goods, which is I think important because by and large libertarian ideology manifests itself in a way in which you're going to have less services, which means that people are going to be more vulnerable to things like corruption, more vulnerable, to things like circumstances out of their control because of their birth. We think that intellectual property rights ensure that creators get to profit off of their efforts to get to profit off of their intellectual property. You have to rebuild the entire power plant they're, not scalar, which means that you're locked in to an inefficient form of energy that won't scale up well in the future. And second, I think that intellectual properties are important to ensure that we are it she's positive outcomes that we maximize innovation and we maximize creation up things that people value from and people appreciate so what's more by talking about the rights claims that we have here, I think it's important to note that if you create a song or if you write a book or if you come up with a work of art or a logo or anything like that, these are things that you created there are no different than saying he I if you spend your money on a plot of land or on a house or something like that. But this is also even something that I think people can generally do with pretty good information because when you're considering getting plastic surgery, it's not like doctors are allowed to not tell you the possible risks of surgery on their usually required by law to talk to you about safety affect us possible side effects of surgery, things like that. We are programmed to rate the other sex based on appearance. We think that often people need to maintain anonymity from a fear of retaliation against it opinions that are expressed for example, opposition view points on a thread that is like largely in favor of one particular position require individuals to be anonymous out of fear of like direct physical offline retaliation if I were to probe post like, for example, a pro hillary post on like our slash that donald it probably wouldn't go over too well and anonymity is necessary then for me to comfortably express myself in that forum. But now you don't have university officials trying to mitigate those harms, but regarding freedom of association, we actually think that people have the right to form these types of groups that if people want to associate with a group of like minded friends and call themselves some stupid name with great characters, then there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to do that the other team needs to explain to you why this is different than having something like a volleyball lacrosse team where many of the same harms might be perpetrated, but they happen to share a common interest in sports. The first is that the first trimester is not enough time for people to make the decision whether or not to have an abortion, the other side tells you that there are okay with allowing people to exercise their choice during the first few months of pregnancy, but we think that there are many reasons why someone might need or want an abortion very reasonably after that time period. This makes it harder for your workers to interact with the rest of the globe, disincentive eyes as foreign direct investment, and ultimately makes it harder for your country to catch up with the more developed countries. The very beginning of this debate is that it has been a cultural institution within the communities that practices such as spain, portugal and parts of southern france for hundreds of years, fighting's tied in with the cultural identity of these regions, deep way it has been part of festivals and celebrations of triumphs and of the history of these people in the culture of these people for hundreds of years. We should not ban cosmetic surgery, I'm going to present three arguments for why this is the case first personal freedom, we think that it is fundamentally arbitrary to ban cosmetic surgery when we allow people to make lots of other ultimately harmful decisions in order to pursue a more attractive figure or face, we think that prince since we allow people to take on a diet supplements and things like that that are heavily regulated we allow people to diet and exercise in unhealthy ways. You allow free reign to help free reign of alcohol to young people, especially people that don't have the life experience and the mental development to understand how to drink responsibly you're more likely to have these people become alcoholics in their life. So with drinking, particularly that we think that children are uninformed and the consequences of this action and as such it is reasonable to proxy off the decision about whether or not they can engage in drinking to a parent. Yes on this, we think this creates more tension also leads the pitting of countries one against the other at the point that the US can blame any country that to first china's opinion for not letting their proposal through those countries are more likely to get targeted meaning that this kind of tension is antithetical more so than anything else to the u n's purpose are secondary of clash, has to do with why these countries have earned their right to veto and what if we take it away the impacts are much worse. So the fact that this is something that's gonna so heavily prevalent in spanish culture, and so many people go to it home, probably signals that a lot of people, you know, get a kick out of this that they goodwill fighting offense in this is something they do with their family. If the government bans cosmetic surgery, that's a massive government overstepped its the government taking it upon themselves to mold social norms as they see desirable and unfairly interfering in people's lives, if it's that person's body, the government shouldn't be interfering with that it's, not as of cosmetic surgeries being forced on anyone else, they probably it can also make the money calculus themselves on the good, not being questioned about decision. So we think at the point where government is confusing the chicken and the egg, I don't think you get rid of sexism by getting rid of beauty pageants",20,17
"438,454,518,31,202,348,112,210,123,61,330,136,104,241,436,177,300,347,66,354","There will be no way for a musician or an author to pay their bills if they can't make money off of their work to even if you think that copy right should end at the artist's death it's clear that at least during the time that the real life they need copyright in order to be able to feed themselves and their families so that they can keep producing their work, but on a more concrete level you'll also see things like less drug development, it cost over a billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical drugs. And I don't think that getting rid of france is actually going to change a whole lot as far as like the way that like women feel safe on campus, probably much more effective would be just like trying to make it so that men are less likely to be problematic, rather than just trying to ban organizations that part that might contribute to these kinds of things are not really attacking the root cause of the problem you're just kind of attracting like attacking a symptom of it or like a method of it, but I think also beyond that, obviously, there's other organizations that operate similarly, there is teasing and like parties and things like that for sports teams like on other clubs and things like that do that to like the brand is to beat teams from parties before like. We usually say that eighteen year old probably shouldn't drink because they're prefrontal cortex is growing expanding and essentially becoming more effective alcohol can inhibit this, but if children as young as ten are drinking alcohol, the entirety of their brain is growing their forening, the synapses that will be effective in living for their entire lives, they consume alcohol at this young age, we would say that they were likely to face profound consequences for their overall development, the likely to face more issues later in life, anger, issues emotional issues as they are not able to effectively grow. The current subsidies of bio fuel are incredibly inefficient and have generally been opposed. Well, beauty is only one metric of judging the human being it's, not invalid for someone to be empowered by their beauty and to want to express that through these type of contests. When the federal government forces schools to take certain actions very bad things happen is essential that schools have control over their own curriculum and over their own time, when the federal government gets involved, the act with a new one, it is impossible to regulate every single school in the fact of way we would say that schools in poverty, it schools in low income areas which do not have access to ample physical education equipment and who do not have the resources to watch kids all going outside at the same time, probably do not need physical education. We think it's unfair that you restrict that choice and trying to find solutions to issues and solutions to a patriarchal system. What this means is that every year that teens get older, they are able to make better and better decisions biologically, but on top of that, every decision that you make is informed by past experience, people who have more experience are more likely to be able to make good decisions. Before you reach up further tipping point, we think that even if you are able to get unconventional oil in a clean way, even if you're able to do it without destroying ecosystems you're only adding to the problem in the status quo you're, only allowing for more dirty energy to be produced, which we think is unacceptable is unacceptable is only going to lead to dramatic harms for the future of society for future people. Anyway, they do attendance for another five minutes than you do like you like mass around for other ten minutes, probably like at the end of the day, you're, not really doing all that much additionally p, e, oftentimes isn't all that enjoyable for people and it's not that enjoyable for people because different people like to exercise in different ways. But additionally, we think this will generally just lead to worse relations between states if the one is now a political entity, which is passing horrific policies that will come at it as an object of opposition towards groups like NATO and other international bodies, which seat will see it as a press, seven problematic for this reason we should abolish we should not abolish the security council veto. And because you can get high concentrations of higher concentrations of mercury as a result of that, but in addition to the direct harms of fracking there's also incredibly prominent in direct harms that come from fracking, namely that further dependence on oil and other non renewable sources of energy like it are very unclean source of energy will only further on lead to more global warming and climate change. We should not ban for us because banning frats won't do any good, it unfairly targets, racks and the consequences will actually be a whole lot worse. We also just think the problem on their side of the house is that like if the person cares enough they'll find a way to do it, even if it's not the black market like things like waist, trainers can have awful affect your health bilik shifting your bones around in a way that like a regular tummy talk never would second the we want to talk about research benefits because recognize that because there is more money in cosmetic surgery so rich people pay more money so they can look prettier than a lot of the time it actually the discoveries made actually flow over to the areas that have less money. So we think at the point where government is confusing the chicken and the egg, I don't think you get rid of sexism by getting rid of beauty pageants. First on why this is simply a good intermediate tool for law enforcement to use given that on the given that without it. And you end up in the kind of power discounts relationships that we're talking about it's just true that there's something wrong with the twenty eight year old who's dating sixteen year old that sixteen year old probably needs to be protected from them. Fourteen certainly is not ready inherent and frankly frequent to risk of sex being pregnancy means that we should not put children in a situation which is possible to have a child due to the actions that they take by banning it, we will decrease the total incidents of pregnancy to a great extent and allow individuals live a better quality of life into the long term. For example, you can test and winners are able to make money and get some sort of a platforms in the contest and they win whether it's a large pat platformer, small platform depends obviously on the size, but we think that women are able to use their success in these contests to further propagate themselves whether it be in the business world or whatever other interests they may have, and we can that's a positive thing for women to be able to do and to be able to take hold of their own empowerment for these things. We allow individuals to smoke cigarettes to get breast implants because we value individual freedom more than we value societal outcomes in so far as we want to avoid recognizing the individual because that tends to be abusive in so far as the goddess, idiosyncratic, and this has clearly been deemed to be good by society let it stand proud to oppose",20,19
"498,109,412,249,91,121,517,202,94,139,13,448,248,282,123,41,102,284,76,452","I p because you can just take the I p from others and re packaging rebranded what this means on mass is that you're going to have less market innovation in this house, real world implications in the tech world in the health industry, intellectual property is incredibly important key sectors, and usually the sectors that are driving global growth and global innovation. So because it's an anti colonial institution because it promotes development and because it will be to peace in the region, we should not disband ishi on. So if you guys ever want to truly achieve real equality for women who have to oppose this motion. So ultimately we might as well just have the veto to prevent grandstanding an escalation of tensions, which seems likely to arise if we remove the detail. Then we think that a world with plastic surgery is preferable in so far as it allows women to take ownership over their bodies in escape the discriminatory structures that are often flung at women who are seen as less conventionally attractive. We believe that banning cosmetic surgeries harm both the principle of autonomy over one's body and people's identities that first of all, we think that we should distinguish cases of true deformities or for instance, procedures that are meant to restore one's previous looks after he suffered an injury that resulted in some deformities side government doesn't, say anything to that effect all the talk about this botox and like breast enhancement surgeries, obviously, we think that that is a huge impact on the debate and a huge harm that they do not addressed at all moving on. I stand and firm opposition to the motion that we should ban beauty pageants, although my opponent would like to discuss at length, how beauty pageants reinforce an entrenched problematic beauty standards, so unclear how these standards will ever be solved, simply by banning beauty pageants. Well, beauty is only one metric of judging the human being it's, not invalid for someone to be empowered by their beauty and to want to express that through these type of contests. We think that being able to prioritize what is best for your future is very important because it's not the case that everyone is going to go off and need to be incredibly physically active in order to succeed in life. But in addition to that, I also think that they can be more effective in there you like solar energy can be more much more effective in its use of export it compared to wind farms, wind power in now there is a few reasons for this of first and foremost because of the potential for energy. So the next up reason why this is bad is because of safety concerns so miners oftentimes have much more difficulty accessing not just being informed about healthy sexual education, but having access to sexual education as well. It allows them to work together towards a common goal of independence, and it reassures the independence of every member state from international oppression and dependence on one country for trade. They don't understand, they can't conceptualize what brain damage looks like, or what a lifetime of being addicted to alcohol might look like, and also we have to protect them until they can consent into those protect potential harms. We think that intellectual property rights ensure that creators get to profit off of their efforts to get to profit off of their intellectual property. Before you reach up further tipping point, we think that even if you are able to get unconventional oil in a clean way, even if you're able to do it without destroying ecosystems you're only adding to the problem in the status quo you're, only allowing for more dirty energy to be produced, which we think is unacceptable is unacceptable is only going to lead to dramatic harms for the future of society for future people. So specifically government takes issue with the broadness of these laws, but we think that that's good because of how difficult anti social behavior is depend down a lot of the time the specific action, the creates a nuisance is different, and as such it's hard to create a consistent law passed by the legislature in a timely fashion, the pro pro prickly responds to these public nuisances. And we think that not allowing people to do what they desire in restricting their freedom in this sense, is an unfair part of the society. Our second point is that banning anonymous posting is completely unenforceable. Secondly, we think that the anti social behavioral disorders are more adaptable than typical criminal law. And the age of consent is created to protect against it older men and women will always be more experience and be able to leverage emotional power against the younger people, they're sleeping with combine this oftentimes with financial power",20,19
"118,5,38,478,380,291,220,422,13,98,445,468,194,179,24,446,76,286,105,0","If the government bans cosmetic surgery, that's a massive government overstepped its the government taking it upon themselves to mold social norms as they see desirable and unfairly interfering in people's lives, if it's that person's body, the government shouldn't be interfering with that it's, not as of cosmetic surgeries being forced on anyone else, they probably it can also make the money calculus themselves on the good, not being questioned about decision. The first is that we would see the animals do not have rights, and they certainly don't have rights to the extent that protects them from being killed. So we think that generally speaking when third party harms occur on a band is justified because even if people are allowed to consent into harm upon themselves, you are not allowed to consent other people into harm's. Also, these countries haven't had a war between them in years also probably a good thing like we're, not sure what the mark of success yeah, others trying to reach is, but it seems that these countries are at least partially doing well that may be a marker of success to yes, says look there's, no unifying factor, exactly the point. So this is going to mean that people are still going to get cosmetic surgery, but it's going to be let's. So we think that ultimately you really undermine your ability to raise money in the future by banning fraternities. But I think that the fundamental thing that we're going to talk about is why adults ought be able to consent and participate in these kinds of activities as a brief overview. And this is the next thing we want to talk about is that your body is still developing you're, much more likely to impair your mental development to impair your decision making process used to alcohol use while you are young than later in your life when your brain, your body has four more fully developed. So the next up reason why this is bad is because of safety concerns so miners oftentimes have much more difficulty accessing not just being informed about healthy sexual education, but having access to sexual education as well. We should not lower the age of consent, given the way that these laws are both enforced and the necessity for these laws in reality. We think that ultimately even if you want to keep this money focused on climate change, things like providing for people who are displaced by climate change or cleaning up the damage of coal power plants, et cetera would all be better uses of this money that have more immediate tangible impacts for people on the ground thing, giving handouts to large corporations that make cars with bio fuel. Our third and final independent point is that it kills start ups on both in the tech world, and then just sort of like, generally like things like the music industry and the business world at large almost when property rights aren't protected, usually the thing the firm that can bring a product to the market first is the bigger more powerful one. The first independent point is that there is a need for geographic representation that the electoral college uniquely provides. For instance, the US doesn't have to go into the awkward position of defending israel from a foreign invasion because of the UN security council. And that means that I actually am entitled to the existence of this to the ownership over this thing that I created that. But the problem with this is that if an individual isn't old enough to understand the consequences, the action, it isn't reasonable to call that consenting into the action or autonomy by any means our second independent point is that people will always drink before the drinking age gulf makes a lot of noise over the fact that people tend to abuse the drinking age arm and drink before it's legal. Secondly, we think that the anti social behavioral disorders are more adaptable than typical criminal law. And I think that what the fines libertarianism most is our it's extremism in a way in which it values concepts like ownership. So even if our children are expressing sexual behavior or become more curious and exposed to sexuality, this does not mean that they have developed the mental maturity that will allow them to safely engaging actual sexual acts. Adults do they can take actions that harm others such as driving while drunk, we think a higher drinking it allows you to ensure that when people do these types of things you can pull them aside, you can rest them",20,16
"229,340,518,289,63,41,438,362,372,297,200,237,40,402,129,138,296,455,15,454","If you see cosmetic surgery is just a means by which men exert their will upon women and women's bodies than there are plenty of other mechanisms for doing that given that it seems unlikely that plastic surgery bands will actually solve this issue. So if you think that the windows literally anything that is beneficial to little global structure it's important to keep the veto in place, our second independent argument is that increases incentives for clientelism on their side of the house. We usually say that eighteen year old probably shouldn't drink because they're prefrontal cortex is growing expanding and essentially becoming more effective alcohol can inhibit this, but if children as young as ten are drinking alcohol, the entirety of their brain is growing their forening, the synapses that will be effective in living for their entire lives, they consume alcohol at this young age, we would say that they were likely to face profound consequences for their overall development, the likely to face more issues later in life, anger, issues emotional issues as they are not able to effectively grow.

So first and foremost let's talk about why drinking is bad for the health of young people. So specifically government takes issue with the broadness of these laws, but we think that that's good because of how difficult anti social behavior is depend down a lot of the time the specific action, the creates a nuisance is different, and as such it's hard to create a consistent law passed by the legislature in a timely fashion, the pro pro prickly responds to these public nuisances. There will be no way for a musician or an author to pay their bills if they can't make money off of their work to even if you think that copy right should end at the artist's death it's clear that at least during the time that the real life they need copyright in order to be able to feed themselves and their families so that they can keep producing their work, but on a more concrete level you'll also see things like less drug development, it cost over a billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical drugs. You allow free reign to help free reign of alcohol to young people, especially people that don't have the life experience and the mental development to understand how to drink responsibly you're more likely to have these people become alcoholics in their life. For example, if you created a song, if you're a songwriter, you made the song, we think that you should have the ability to determine where that song is played and who gets to use it, for example, many people don't allow politicians to use their music because they are so scene with that music and their brand is associated with that music and they don't want to be politicized or they disagree politician and we can doesn't hardly fair and without intellectual property rights instances like that would not allow the creator to be protected. So it's a balancing factor it's, a system of the checks and balances that were created internally to the u s government it'll, it ensures that those big states get greater representation in a way that the otherwise don't in the senate, which means that in the highest office, those states are balanced out by the fact that in the senate they don't get as much of a voice as many think they should. And we think that that kind of thing should not be banned in so far as women will still have to do things like be attractive for men on both sides of the house. This has is that it's going to lead to the state being more willing to take and more willing to actually spend things on public goods, which is I think important because by and large libertarian ideology manifests itself in a way in which you're going to have less services, which means that people are going to be more vulnerable to things like corruption, more vulnerable, to things like circumstances out of their control because of their birth. We say that disbandment creates huge uncertainty that harms investments it harms the stock market and that's why even if it is in is stagnating, we must things to think of ways to strengthen and improve its before we turn to disband. Our second independent point is third party harms that are generated by consumption of marijuana. I have two arguments in today's debate first, why it's preferable to jail and large fines and secondly, on how social determination is good, but first some free for bottle I for opponents first argument is that there's a right to be me, and I would agree there's, some right to be me in and out of shot, such we give the court's judicial independence and judicial jurisdiction and discretion which allows them to decide what is truly a criminal offense. We think the problem is that he's going to be making a lot more difficult for those who aren't having consensual sex to report it since on his side of the house will have to go through the whole criminal investigation into whether it was actually raped while on ours, the asian itself is enough to protect the kids and make it started tory and justify things like restraining orders on so it keeps them from having to go through that process like recognize it's really rare that two kids are sexting or having sex in their sent to jail because of the same age like no one cares enough to report them at that point. We think that parents are the best proxy for young children on the basis of the children themselves aren't capable of performing informed consent when they're at such a young age, and as such the parent has the best interest of the child in mind because the child can't make these decisions for themselves at that point, then if their parents that don't want their kids to receive sex education, we believe that the a and not the state have the better information on what is and isn't right for their child, proud to oppose. We should not ban cosmetic surgery, I'm going to present three arguments for why this is the case first personal freedom, we think that it is fundamentally arbitrary to ban cosmetic surgery when we allow people to make lots of other ultimately harmful decisions in order to pursue a more attractive figure or face, we think that prince since we allow people to take on a diet supplements and things like that that are heavily regulated we allow people to diet and exercise in unhealthy ways. But now you don't have university officials trying to mitigate those harms, but regarding freedom of association, we actually think that people have the right to form these types of groups that if people want to associate with a group of like minded friends and call themselves some stupid name with great characters, then there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to do that the other team needs to explain to you why this is different than having something like a volleyball lacrosse team where many of the same harms might be perpetrated, but they happen to share a common interest in sports. And I don't think that getting rid of france is actually going to change a whole lot as far as like the way that like women feel safe on campus, probably much more effective would be just like trying to make it so that men are less likely to be problematic, rather than just trying to ban organizations that part that might contribute to these kinds of things are not really attacking the root cause of the problem you're just kind of attracting like attacking a symptom of it or like a method of it, but I think also beyond that, obviously, there's other organizations that operate similarly, there is teasing and like parties and things like that for sports teams like on other clubs and things like that do that to like the brand is to beat teams from parties before like",20,20
"326,114,340,296,188,210,51,139,447,324,497,131,362,97,307,421,445,100,12,269","So I want to talk about what's in avoids talking about in these are specific populations that this proposition is going to be very, very problematic for we're talking, of course, about religious populations where any type of sexual education that is not abstinence only will be perceived by parents as an attempt of the school or of the state to corrupt their children, and we think that the potential to backlash in this sensitive matter is huge as we've already mentioned earlier, schools, avoid inserting politics into the classroom and there's no way around this six is a political issue. But on average, we say that generally eighteen is significantly higher maturity age, especially since at that point, you're becoming an adult and a lot of other ways that you're graduating high school, all of these things are changing your life for a sixteen year old hasn't even come close to dealing with. So if you think that the windows literally anything that is beneficial to little global structure it's important to keep the veto in place, our second independent argument is that increases incentives for clientelism on their side of the house. We think that parents are the best proxy for young children on the basis of the children themselves aren't capable of performing informed consent when they're at such a young age, and as such the parent has the best interest of the child in mind because the child can't make these decisions for themselves at that point, then if their parents that don't want their kids to receive sex education, we believe that the a and not the state have the better information on what is and isn't right for their child, proud to oppose. The other thing that a higher agents and sent us is that it makes people increases the amount of time before someone is likely to become sexually active because there are repercussions to their sexual acts and therefore gives more time for them to learn about things such as safe sex and stds. What this means is that every year that teens get older, they are able to make better and better decisions biologically, but on top of that, every decision that you make is informed by past experience, people who have more experience are more likely to be able to make good decisions. We think there's a far simpler rule, which we can apply which will return better results, which is that we ought not use human beings as a means to an end realize that when you prevent women from having an abortion, you are using them as a tool to bring this child to birth. But in addition to that, I also think that they can be more effective in there you like solar energy can be more much more effective in its use of export it compared to wind farms, wind power in now there is a few reasons for this of first and foremost because of the potential for energy. We think that the impact of this is that people will invest much less of their time and effort into creating intellectual property this as many harms first culturally you'll, see a much reduced output of films and books and other types of cultural goods that rely on intellectual property because artists will be able to support themselves anymore. People are always going to find a way to post anonymously. There are nuances which can only be appreciated by those individuals from the district in which we are making the decision pushing eight on new ones and universal ideology upon these people will likely have disastrous repercussions, but the main purpose of this overview is simply saying in the places where sex education would go off without a hitch, it is already occurring and all others, the two arguments I'm about to make will be actualized. Our third and final argument is that most countries around the world, perhaps all are signatories of international agreements which prohibit the creation and distribution of certain illegal drugs, and that marijuana is one of them. You allow free reign to help free reign of alcohol to young people, especially people that don't have the life experience and the mental development to understand how to drink responsibly you're more likely to have these people become alcoholics in their life. And the reason we shouldn't further exploit when power is because on the comparative it's, not really all that great of a form of energy. Word is wildly on regulated and as such the abuses internalized by animals are much more significant and much more extreme given that then we think there is significant harm intrinsic to making this sort of practice illegal and making it harder to conduct this in an open arms in an open and public fashion where you know, government officials can step in and say these practices are humane. We think that scholarships money in recruitment for jobs like colleges often happen at beauty, pageants people have a right to go for that like I'd like to go to my overview. We think that ultimately even if you want to keep this money focused on climate change, things like providing for people who are displaced by climate change or cleaning up the damage of coal power plants, et cetera would all be better uses of this money that have more immediate tangible impacts for people on the ground thing, giving handouts to large corporations that make cars with bio fuel. This makes it harder for your workers to interact with the rest of the globe, disincentive eyes as foreign direct investment, and ultimately makes it harder for your country to catch up with the more developed countries. What that actually means is that students living in the town around the school have set up unofficial fraternities instead so they're, not regulated by the school. It is still a woman's right to model herself in the male gaze, even if it is something that is bad for society writ large, we think this is about the individual woman's choice and what empowers her not about societal reaction, two main areas of clash, the first on the standards of a ban it is generally accepted that a democratic government can ban something if there is either a large personal harm that requires paternalism, or if large third party harms that allows you to personalize an individual's choices will says but society in the reinforcement of stereo types",20,20
"129,147,169,97,12,113,495,0,407,63,478,410,499,123,163,119,204,277,237,446","I have two arguments in today's debate first, why it's preferable to jail and large fines and secondly, on how social determination is good, but first some free for bottle I for opponents first argument is that there's a right to be me, and I would agree there's, some right to be me in and out of shot, such we give the court's judicial independence and judicial jurisdiction and discretion which allows them to decide what is truly a criminal offense. When you privatize out the services you make life very, very difficult for people that don't have the means to deal with the private sector, I think that's a significant problem, and I think that it leads to a lot of suffering. So the first thing that the previous speaker tells you is that the government has a responsibility to educate to six just like the government needs to educate its pupils on any other aspect. And the reason we shouldn't further exploit when power is because on the comparative it's, not really all that great of a form of energy. What that actually means is that students living in the town around the school have set up unofficial fraternities instead so they're, not regulated by the school. And this is what we heard from the last speaker about as well we're going to propose a slightly different standard, though, we think that the state should do something for people when there is an imbalance in power or information that the state needs to correct war when there are harms to third parties and I'll explain in a minute way, I don't think that the objective good is a proper standard. So first on fairness, broadly we would say that property rights are important and all be protected, we would say that people exert effort time and put their own labor into the products of their creation, and because they are the sole creators of the primary creators of their products. Adults do they can take actions that harm others such as driving while drunk, we think a higher drinking it allows you to ensure that when people do these types of things you can pull them aside, you can rest them. The reason for this is that not a whole because renewable energies are at this moment, not very profitable and it's not something that investors are looking to you really invested in the status quo. So first and foremost let's talk about why drinking is bad for the health of young people. Also, these countries haven't had a war between them in years also probably a good thing like we're, not sure what the mark of success yeah, others trying to reach is, but it seems that these countries are at least partially doing well that may be a marker of success to yes, says look there's, no unifying factor, exactly the point. So this is specifically why we think that there's a proactive right to be anonymous on the internet. So it can disrupt like bird migration patterns, and it can kill birds that's, like a widely documented thing and that's not good because birds are important. Before you reach up further tipping point, we think that even if you are able to get unconventional oil in a clean way, even if you're able to do it without destroying ecosystems you're only adding to the problem in the status quo you're, only allowing for more dirty energy to be produced, which we think is unacceptable is unacceptable is only going to lead to dramatic harms for the future of society for future people. So we believe that especially at a young age like in your teenage years children again, don't have access to the necessary information to make informed decisions on everything that they do given that we afford a lot of latitude to parents in being essentially the proxies for their best interest because parents do have access to that information they've lived longer lives and understand more about the world. We tell you that the kinds of extremist you might want to stop from talking online are still able to do so therefore so there's, no successful affected this policy for all these reasons we should not ban anonymous posting. So we think that it's particularly problematic to put children in a position where they are more subject to sort of like bullying and social pressures. And the second is that people should be allowed to take risks in that risk aversion and trying to maximize the length of one's life is not the only metric of a good life lived. This has is that it's going to lead to the state being more willing to take and more willing to actually spend things on public goods, which is I think important because by and large libertarian ideology manifests itself in a way in which you're going to have less services, which means that people are going to be more vulnerable to things like corruption, more vulnerable, to things like circumstances out of their control because of their birth. But the problem with this is that if an individual isn't old enough to understand the consequences, the action, it isn't reasonable to call that consenting into the action or autonomy by any means our second independent point is that people will always drink before the drinking age gulf makes a lot of noise over the fact that people tend to abuse the drinking age arm and drink before it's legal",20,19
"471,162,285,0,269,15,483,44,268,266,439,74,236,34,277,301,62,294,475,510","The nature of the internet is that no one country can regulate it. But we think that what's important here is that there is a precedent not to sell recreational drugs when the public believes that they are unethical or ought not be used and to sell them on the public supports them. My third argument is the idea of regulation you cannot trust individuals to police themselves. Adults do they can take actions that harm others such as driving while drunk, we think a higher drinking it allows you to ensure that when people do these types of things you can pull them aside, you can rest them. It is still a woman's right to model herself in the male gaze, even if it is something that is bad for society writ large, we think this is about the individual woman's choice and what empowers her not about societal reaction, two main areas of clash, the first on the standards of a ban it is generally accepted that a democratic government can ban something if there is either a large personal harm that requires paternalism, or if large third party harms that allows you to personalize an individual's choices will says but society in the reinforcement of stereo types. But now you don't have university officials trying to mitigate those harms, but regarding freedom of association, we actually think that people have the right to form these types of groups that if people want to associate with a group of like minded friends and call themselves some stupid name with great characters, then there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to do that the other team needs to explain to you why this is different than having something like a volleyball lacrosse team where many of the same harms might be perpetrated, but they happen to share a common interest in sports. There are few political ideologies as fundamentally misconstrued as fundamentally miss championed as libertarianism is a system which favors the rich and the powerful, although the adoption of libertarianism in many ways seems like the adoption of natural forms of power, natural ways of thinking. And being able to post anonymously, brings a kind of shield your identity, and it makes it more likely that you could be willing to engage and express your thoughts in the first place. So our first argument is that these anti social behavior orders are necessary to fight harassment, recognize that before the mid twentieth century, when these policies started to be implemented, there just was no legal way to fight against harassment. So we think that you have to protect them first because they don't because consuming alcohol can physically prevent them from being able to function in the long term we also talk about the long term habits that it creates when you start bringing young, it also means you're starting habits and addictions early on. So we think that criminal law should be concerned op, principally with mitigating damage upon innocent people and preventing them from experiencing harm, even if the harm is somewhat minimal at that point, then we think the anti social behavioral disorders are uniquely equipped to deal with that three independent points pertaining to the mechanisms by which the anti social behavioral disorders mitigate the proliferation of anti social behavior. Second independent argument is that principally people should just have intellectual property rights because they created these things on government. My second argument is the effect on small states because we believe this will create huge amounts of infighting between smaller states in the united nations as they are now passing policies which have dramatic implications, and they are targeted by the you and they're likely to leave it is unlikely the unlikely that the u n will conduct a large scale ground operations against any state unless they're committing genocide, and as such there is very little risk to leaving if you're being targeted through declarations and hollow threats. We think that every given person in society knows their own best interest and their own long term goals better than the government knows any individual goals, we think the government should probably intervene if there are harms to others or if people are grossly lacking in information but that's, not the case here no one else is harmed all deal more with this in just a minute, but no one else is harmed by you choosing to get facelift and in terms of access to information doctors are already legally obliged to provide you with a great deal of information. And the second is that people should be allowed to take risks in that risk aversion and trying to maximize the length of one's life is not the only metric of a good life lived. Our first independent point is principled that is that we think there is an actual property rights claim to intellectual property, and that there is a principle justification for preserving back right, so I think generally we respect property rights because we see property is an extension of the self that is awesome autonomy. We think that there are two better alternatives in regards to renewable energy sources that we should exploit instead of wind power given the fund abilities and the limits of spending in the status quo. We tell you that ultimately, the huge drop in oil prices globally has done more to harm ordinary people living in petroleum states that it's done to their governments. We think that this further decreases the efficiency of wind power and makes it incredibly difficult to actually power whole cities as such the other more reliable from technology will have to be adopted. I think that the government would point out to you that cosmetic surgery is involved in a large series of norms that are problematic to the average person that they perpetuate body problem",20,19
"436,202,300,295,509,432,321,355,31,359,418,438,236,446,256,326,375,354,283,289","So we think at the point where government is confusing the chicken and the egg, I don't think you get rid of sexism by getting rid of beauty pageants. Well, beauty is only one metric of judging the human being it's, not invalid for someone to be empowered by their beauty and to want to express that through these type of contests. And you end up in the kind of power discounts relationships that we're talking about it's just true that there's something wrong with the twenty eight year old who's dating sixteen year old that sixteen year old probably needs to be protected from them. They don't really need need maintenance wind turbines on the other hand, are going to have to be continually upgraded in order to meet our requirements for new energy and it's, not as simple as just attaching a bigger rotor. One of those conditions would be say an asymmetry of information that causes direct harm upon the individual because medics surgery doesn't do that you doctors that inform you about what's going to happen with that cosmetic surgery, and the vast majority of cosmetic surgery is safe. So we're gonna get two broad reasons for why we think it is unjust to ban cosmetic surgery. This is math english literature pushing the a certain subject at the detriment of all of the others does little more than create a political system for schools, which does not serve the general genuine purpose of schools, which is educating their students. So even if you don't buy like all three of these standards on any one of them is sufficient to trigger a band being justified, our first independent point is that there is an information asymmetry intrinsic to marijuana consumption. The current subsidies of bio fuel are incredibly inefficient and have generally been opposed. But this is also even something that I think people can generally do with pretty good information because when you're considering getting plastic surgery, it's not like doctors are allowed to not tell you the possible risks of surgery on their usually required by law to talk to you about safety affect us possible side effects of surgery, things like that. Our second independent point is that this essentially allows women to have ownership over their bodies, the can mitigate the effects of the sexist society all get into this more in a bit, but I want to establish that sexist norms are going to exist on either side of the house. There will be no way for a musician or an author to pay their bills if they can't make money off of their work to even if you think that copy right should end at the artist's death it's clear that at least during the time that the real life they need copyright in order to be able to feed themselves and their families so that they can keep producing their work, but on a more concrete level you'll also see things like less drug development, it cost over a billion dollars to develop a new pharmaceutical drugs. My second argument is the effect on small states because we believe this will create huge amounts of infighting between smaller states in the united nations as they are now passing policies which have dramatic implications, and they are targeted by the you and they're likely to leave it is unlikely the unlikely that the u n will conduct a large scale ground operations against any state unless they're committing genocide, and as such there is very little risk to leaving if you're being targeted through declarations and hollow threats. But the problem with this is that if an individual isn't old enough to understand the consequences, the action, it isn't reasonable to call that consenting into the action or autonomy by any means our second independent point is that people will always drink before the drinking age gulf makes a lot of noise over the fact that people tend to abuse the drinking age arm and drink before it's legal. So first I'm, like a principled level, the idea of libertarianism is that were most free if there's minimal state intervention, we have ownership over our own property, but I think the problem is that when you have minimal state intervention, things you don't actually even achieve the outcome of people being most free. So I want to talk about what's in avoids talking about in these are specific populations that this proposition is going to be very, very problematic for we're talking, of course, about religious populations where any type of sexual education that is not abstinence only will be perceived by parents as an attempt of the school or of the state to corrupt their children, and we think that the potential to backlash in this sensitive matter is huge as we've already mentioned earlier, schools, avoid inserting politics into the classroom and there's no way around this six is a political issue. The lithium ion batteries are becoming more and more sophisticated, which means that the cost curve for producing solar power is much lower than that of wind power it's simply a more affect of way of storing and holding energy and it's more applicable to smaller scale. We allow individuals to smoke cigarettes to get breast implants because we value individual freedom more than we value societal outcomes in so far as we want to avoid recognizing the individual because that tends to be abusive in so far as the goddess, idiosyncratic, and this has clearly been deemed to be good by society let it stand proud to oppose. And although many individuals like to pretend as the bio fuels are more efficient or better for the environment, most bio fuels are actually worse than fossil fuels. Yes on this, we think this creates more tension also leads the pitting of countries one against the other at the point that the US can blame any country that to first china's opinion for not letting their proposal through those countries are more likely to get targeted meaning that this kind of tension is antithetical more so than anything else to the u n's purpose are secondary of clash, has to do with why these countries have earned their right to veto and what if we take it away the impacts are much worse",20,20
"197,412,204,62,16,461,32,284,297,421,231,468,367,66,422,372,397,381,264,447","And the reason for this is because I'm, if we want people to say create music, people are going to be able to spend their lives creating music or art or things like that unless you give them a way to make money off of that. So if you guys ever want to truly achieve real equality for women who have to oppose this motion. So we think that it's particularly problematic to put children in a position where they are more subject to sort of like bullying and social pressures. We think that there are two better alternatives in regards to renewable energy sources that we should exploit instead of wind power given the fund abilities and the limits of spending in the status quo. And this is for a couple of reasons, first and foremost, because the younger people are less likely to be mature they're, more likely going to act irresponsibly when they're under the influence of alcohol. We should not ban beauty pageants and just to be clear what we're defending on our side, we would be fine with having a minimum age to enter beauty pageants, but we think that it would be wrong to categorically banned them completely and society. If you want people to be creative, then you need to offer them some sort of reward to incentivize them to develop those skills so were fewer people have unique skills in a world where you don't allow intellectual property rights. Our second point is that banning anonymous posting is completely unenforceable. So it's a balancing factor it's, a system of the checks and balances that were created internally to the u s government it'll, it ensures that those big states get greater representation in a way that the otherwise don't in the senate, which means that in the highest office, those states are balanced out by the fact that in the senate they don't get as much of a voice as many think they should. We think that scholarships money in recruitment for jobs like colleges often happen at beauty, pageants people have a right to go for that like I'd like to go to my overview. And our final point is about boxing a serious concern in many online communities is that people will release the real identities of anonymous posters when you ban anonymous posting effectively, you docks everyone suddenly all of the posts made previously by anonymous users are going to be attached to a name, even if the person made them under the impression that those posted remain anonymous and moral for anyone who was a free to being docks will now be unable to make similar posts in the future, whether they be closeted or politically subversive because now effectively, everyone is stocks. Our third and final independent point is that it kills start ups on both in the tech world, and then just sort of like, generally like things like the music industry and the business world at large almost when property rights aren't protected, usually the thing the firm that can bring a product to the market first is the bigger more powerful one. So we don't think we should single out people who participate in beauty pageants. For example, you can test and winners are able to make money and get some sort of a platforms in the contest and they win whether it's a large pat platformer, small platform depends obviously on the size, but we think that women are able to use their success in these contests to further propagate themselves whether it be in the business world or whatever other interests they may have, and we can that's a positive thing for women to be able to do and to be able to take hold of their own empowerment for these things. And this is the next thing we want to talk about is that your body is still developing you're, much more likely to impair your mental development to impair your decision making process used to alcohol use while you are young than later in your life when your brain, your body has four more fully developed. For example, if you created a song, if you're a songwriter, you made the song, we think that you should have the ability to determine where that song is played and who gets to use it, for example, many people don't allow politicians to use their music because they are so scene with that music and their brand is associated with that music and they don't want to be politicized or they disagree politician and we can doesn't hardly fair and without intellectual property rights instances like that would not allow the creator to be protected. So there's, really nothing that you could actually do about banning fraternities in an off campus, informal capacity. So when you drastically roll back the government and people start dying of easily preventable illnesses, and there are no public schools and people are starving, all of us will be responsible for that it is an act of aggression, not to have a large and generous social safety net. My second argument is that there are third party harms of this particular action. We think that the impact of this is that people will invest much less of their time and effort into creating intellectual property this as many harms first culturally you'll, see a much reduced output of films and books and other types of cultural goods that rely on intellectual property because artists will be able to support themselves anymore",20,20
